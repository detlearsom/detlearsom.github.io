A cyber security research 
project at [University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics][informatics]
with a range of past and present collaborators including Einburgh Parallel Computing Centre][epcc],
[British Telecom Labs in Adastral Park][BT],
[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI)][FFI]
and 
[The Alan Turing Institute][ATI].

*By combining methods from machine learning and formal verification,
we plan to learn precise semantic models of software and
devices which describe normal traffic patterns and logging
behaviours. Then anomalous, potentially malicious behaviours stand
out as being different to these learned behaviours.  The eventual
aim is to build an adaptive anomaly detection framework, to raise
alarms to help manage and automatically configure application-level
firewalls.*
